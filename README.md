## A Collection of Algorithms
Author: Emily Quinn Finney

My implementations of algorithms discussed in Stanford's Coursera Algorithms 
specialization (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). As per 
the Coursera honor code, this does not include any algorithms that solve the 
course's programming assignments. The only algorithms included are those 
described in lectures that are not required as homework, or are modified 
versions of homework algorithms. Several algorithms implemented for interview practice are also included.

This module is tested with Python's doctests library. Running the code suffices
to run the doctests, and examples are shown in each function's docstrings.
